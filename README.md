* MSBuild Integration

# Usage

## Command Line

```Batchfile
Confuser.CLI.exe <path to project file>
```

The project file is a ConfuserEx Project (*.crproj).
The format of project file can be found in docs\ProjectFormat.md

## User Interface

The `ConfuserEx.exe` provides a WPF based user interface for the Windows Platform. Simply start the executable, the
user interface allows setting up the confuser project files.

## MSBuild

ConfuserEx 2 has a integration into MSBuild using the NuGet Package that is produced by the `Confuser.MSBuild.Tasks`
project. Once enabled in any other .NET project it will find a `*.crproj` file next to the project file and populate
it automatically with the probing paths of all the dependency assemblies (including the NuGet packages) of the project
and create the obfuscated assemblies automatically.

The nuget package can be accessed using the [AppVeyor Nuget Feed](https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/confuserex-r4olq7m3uysu)
or it has to be self-hosted.
